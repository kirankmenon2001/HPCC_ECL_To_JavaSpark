    "1. Script Overview": {
    "Summary": "The ECL script automates the process of spraying datasets from a remote directory into the HPCC Systems environment. It addresses the business problem of managing large-scale clinical trial data ingestion and ensures traceability and consistency in data processing.",
    "Functional Modules": [
    "Directory Listing: Uses STD.File.RemoteDirectory to list files in a remote directory.",
    "File Name Transformation: A TRANSFORM function trims the last 4 characters from file names.",
    "Data Spraying: Uses STD.File.SprayVariable to spray datasets into the HPCC Systems environment.",
    "Output Generation: Outputs the list of sprayed files using OUTPUT."
    ],
    "Data Pipelines Overview": "The script orchestrates a linear data flow starting with directory listing, followed by file name transformation, data spraying, and output generation. It ensures efficient ingestion and preparation of clinical trial datasets for downstream analytics workflows."
