    "DATASET declarations: AACT.File_Clinical_Study, AACT.File_Clinical_Study_noclob, AACT.File_Arm_Groups, AACT.File_Results_Outcome_Analysis_Grp, AACT.File_Results_Outcome_Meas_Cat, AACT.File_Results_Baseline_Meas_Cat, AACT.File_Results_Partflow_Mlstn_Grp, AACT.File_Reported_Event_Cat_Grp",
    "TRANSFORM logic: roll_rec for rollup aggregation, inline TRANSFORMs for dataset projections",
    "PROJECT operations: roag, romc, rbmc, rpmg, recg",
    "ROLLUP operation: Aggregates arm group data",
    "OUTPUT operation: Generates sorted and structured output"
