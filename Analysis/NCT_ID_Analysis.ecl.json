    "1. Script Overview": {
    "Summary": "This ECL script processes clinical trial data by extracting and analyzing NCT IDs from various datasets. It integrates multiple datasets from the AACT library to provide insights into data coverage, cardinality, and missing records. The script is crucial for ensuring data traceability and completeness in clinical trial reporting systems.",
    "Functional Modules": [
    "DATASET declarations for empty and extracted results.",
    "TRANSFORM logic for NCT ID extraction and aggregation.",
    "PROJECT operations for dataset transformation.",
    "JOIN operations for merging datasets.",
    "TABLE constructs for summarization.",
    "OUTPUT statements for result generation."
    ],
    "Data Pipelines Overview": "The script begins by extracting NCT IDs from various datasets using the `Extract_ID` macro. These datasets are then combined into a single dataset (`raw_ds`) and filtered to exclude records with empty NCT IDs (`all_ds`). Aggregations and transformations are performed to analyze data coverage, cardinality, and missing records. Outputs are generated to summarize findings and provide insights into data completeness and distribution."
