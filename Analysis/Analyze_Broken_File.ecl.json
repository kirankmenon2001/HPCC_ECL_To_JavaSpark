    "1. Script Overview": {
      "Description": "The `Analyze_Broken_File.ecl` script is designed to process clinical trial datasets stored in Thor-based systems. Its primary objective is to analyze raw data files, extract metadata, summarize statistical information, and generate structured reports. The script automates the analysis of clinical trial data, ensuring data quality and consistency. Key operations include data projection, transformation, grouping, summarization, and output generation.",

    "3. Feature Compatibility Check": {
      "Implicit Schema Typing": "ECL's RECORD structures have no direct Spark equivalent.",
      "Recordsets": "Spark uses DataFrames or RDDs instead.",
      "Dataset Transformations": "PROJECT, ROLLUP, DENORMALIZE need manual mapping to Spark operations.",
      "Global Aggregates": "AGGREGATE with GROUP needs refactoring to Spark's groupBy and aggregate functions."

    "4. Manual Adjustments for Java Spark Migration": {
      "TRANSFORMs to UDFs": "Convert `getData`, `bldReport`, and `addStats` to Spark UDFs.",

      "JOIN Logic": "Implement equivalent join conditions using Spark's join APIs.",
      "NORMALIZE, ROLLUP, DEDUP": "Use Spark's groupBy, reduce, and distinct operations.",
      "OUTPUT Targets": "Rewrite to save outputs in HDFS, Parquet, or other Spark-supported formats."

    "5. Optimization Techniques in Spark": {
      "Broadcast Joins": "Use for small datasets to avoid shuffle joins.",
      "Partitioning": "Partition datasets based on key fields for efficient processing.",
      "Caching/Checkpointing": "Cache intermediate datasets to reduce recomputation.",
      "Catalyst Optimizer": "Leverage Spark's optimizer for query planning and execution.",
      "DataFrame API Improvements": "Use DataFrame operations for better performance."
    },
    "Recommendation": "Rebuild the logic for better alignment with Spark. While refactoring is possible, rebuilding ensures optimal use of Spark's capabilities and avoids compatibility issues with ECL-specific constructs.",
    "Key Outputs": "The final output dataset (`AACT_Data`) contains structured reports with metrics like column counts, record counts, and statistical summaries. This dataset supports data quality assurance and compliance in clinical trials.",
    "Summary": "This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the script's structure, complexity, and migration readiness, ensuring a smooth transition to Java Spark."
