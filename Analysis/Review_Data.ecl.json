    "1. Script Overview": {
    "Summary": "This ECL script processes clinical trial data from various datasets provided by the AACT system. It generates summaries, counts, and samples for different types of clinical trial information, such as outcomes, reported events, baseline measures, and participant flows.",
    "Functional Modules": [
    "DATASET declarations for importing data from AACT system.",
    "TABLE transformations for grouping and counting data.",
    "OUTPUT statements for exporting results, including summaries, counts, and samples."
    ],
    "Data Pipelines Overview": "The script orchestrates data flows by importing datasets, applying transformations such as grouping and counting, and exporting structured outputs for downstream analysis and reporting."

    "Transform Refactoring": "Refactor TABLE transformations into Spark DataFrame operations with groupBy and agg functions.",
    "Schema Redefinition": "Convert implicit RECORD structures into explicit case classes or schema definitions.",
    "Join Handling Strategy": "No JOIN operations present in the script.",
    "Complex Ops Handling": "Rewrite COUNT(GROUP) operations using Spark's groupBy and count methods.",
    "Output Refactoring": "Replace OUTPUT statements with Spark DataFrame writes to HDFS or Parquet with appropriate naming conventions."

    "Join Optimization": "Not applicable as no JOIN operations are present.",
    "Partitioning Strategy": "Partition datasets based on key fields such as outcome_type or event_type to optimize groupBy operations.",
    "Caching Strategy": "Cache intermediate results for frequently accessed datasets, such as t_outcomes or t_re.",
    "Code Optimization Techniques": "Leverage Spark Catalyst optimizer for efficient query planning and execution.",
    "Refactor vs Rebuild Recommendation": {
    "Approach": "Refactor with minimal changes.",
    "Justification": "The script's logic is straightforward and can be mapped to Spark operations with minimal adjustments."
