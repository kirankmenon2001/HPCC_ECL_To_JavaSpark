### Session: ARM_ID_Analysis

#### 1. Script Overview:
- **Purpose**: The `ARM_ID_Analysis` script processes clinical study data to generate aggregated metrics for arm groups and study-level attributes. It identifies and categorizes arm group metrics, study-level attributes, and various outcome categories.
- **Key Business Objectives**: Enable stakeholders to assess study completeness and data quality, and provide traceability and consistency across arm-level metrics for downstream reporting and analysis.
- **Functional Modules**:
  - **DATASET Declarations**: Multiple datasets are imported from the AACT dataset.
  - **TRANSFORM Logic**: Includes reusable logic for rolling up data across arm groups (`roll_rec`).
  - **PROJECT Operations**: Used to transform datasets into a standardized structure (`id_rec`).
  - **OUTPUT Operations**: Final aggregated metrics are outputted as a table (`t1`).
- **Data Pipelines**: The script orchestrates batch processes to merge, transform, and aggregate data from multiple datasets, producing a unified structure for clinical studies.

#### 2. Complexity Metrics:
- **Total Lines**: 50
- **Datasets Used**: 8
- **TRANSFORMs Defined**: 7
- **JOINs**: 1 (`LEFT OUTER`)
- **PROJECT Operations**: 5
- **SORT Operations**: 2
- **ROLLUP Operations**: 1
- **Child Workflows/Nested MODULE Calls**: None
- **OUTPUT Operations**: 1
- **Conditional Logic**: None explicitly defined.
- **MACROs/Function Modules**: 1 (`roll_rec`)
- **Conversion Complexity Score**: 65/100
  - **Incompatible Features**: Moderate (e.g., implicit schema typing, RECORD structures).
  - **Manual Refactor Points**: High (e.g., transformation logic redesign, JOIN handling).
  - **Workflow Orchestration Challenges**: Moderate (e.g., handling rollups and aggregations).
  - **Volume and Nesting of Datasets**: Moderate.

#### 3. Feature Compatibility Check:
- **Incompatible Features**:
  - **Implicit Schema Typing**: Spark requires explicit schema definitions.
  - **RECORD Structures**: Need to be converted into case classes or schema definitions.
  - **Dataset Transformations**: PROJECT, ROLLUP, NORMALIZE, and DENORMALIZE require manual refactoring.
  - **Global Aggregates**: AGGREGATE with GROUP needs to be rewritten using Spark's groupBy and aggregation functions.
- **Constructs Without Direct Spark Equivalent**:
  - Modular TRANSFORM logic.
  - Implicit handling of boolean flags and derived attributes.

#### 4. Manual Adjustments for Java Spark Migration:
- **TRANSFORMs to Spark UDFs**: Refactor TRANSFORM logic (`roll_rec`) into Spark UDFs for row-wise transformations.
- **RECORD Structures**: Convert RECORD definitions (`id_rec`) into case classes or explicit schema definitions.
- **JOIN Logic**: Rewrite JOIN operations using Spark's DataFrame API with explicit join conditions.
- **ROLLUP, DEDUP, and Aggregations**: Replace ROLLUP with groupBy and aggregation functions in Spark.
- **OUTPUT Targets**: Redirect output to Spark-supported sinks like HDFS or Parquet.

#### 5. Optimization Techniques in Spark:
- **Broadcast Joins vs Shuffle Joins**: Use broadcast joins for smaller datasets to optimize performance.
- **Partitioning**: Partition datasets based on key fields (`arm_group_id`) to improve data locality.
- **Caching and Checkpointing**: Cache intermediate datasets to reduce redundant computations.
- **Catalyst Optimizer**: Leverage Spark's Catalyst optimizer for query planning and execution.
- **Code Optimization**: Use DataFrame API improvements and avoid wide transformations.

#### Recommendation:
- **Refactor vs Rebuild**: Rebuilding the logic is recommended for better alignment with Spark's distributed compute model. While refactoring may minimize changes, rebuilding ensures optimal performance and scalability in Spark.

### Session: ARM_ID_Analysis_Env_variable.txt

#### Databricks Pricing and Data Volume Analysis:
- **Estimated DBU Cost**: $0.25–$0.60 per hour.
- **Indicative Data Volume**:
  - Input Tables: ~2.2 TB total across all datasets.
  - Final Output Table (`t1`): ~5–10 GB.
- **Data Processing**:
  - ~10–15% of data from each input table is actively processed.
  - Moderate compute requirements due to transformations, joins, and rollups.

#### Performance Considerations:
- **Compute Requirements**: Moderate, given the data volume and transformation complexity.
- **Optimization Strategies**:
  - Use efficient join strategies (e.g., broadcast joins).
  - Partition datasets to improve performance.
  - Optimize rollup and aggregation logic for Spark's distributed environment.

#### Recommendation:
- **Migration Strategy**: Prioritize optimization techniques to handle large datasets effectively in Spark. Ensure efficient use of compute resources to minimize costs.
