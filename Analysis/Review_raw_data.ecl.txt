### Session: Review_raw_data.ecl

#### 1. Script Overview:
The `Review_raw_data.ecl` script processes clinical trial datasets to extract, transform, and summarize information. It generates a comprehensive report on the structure and content of the data, ensuring data quality and consistency. The script connects to Thor file systems and performs operations like data projection, transformation, rollup, and denormalization.

**Functional Modules:**
- **DATASET Declarations:** Multiple datasets are declared for clinical trial data files.
- **TRANSFORM Logic:** Used for enriching data with additional attributes.
- **PROJECT Operations:** Applied to filter and transform datasets.
- **ROLLUP and DENORMALIZE:** Used for aggregation and combining datasets.
- **OUTPUT:** Produces a named dataset `AACT_Data`.

**Data Pipelines:** The script reads datasets, applies transformations, aggregates data, and outputs a detailed report.

#### 2. Complexity Metrics:
- **Total Lines:** 120
- **Datasets Used:** 40
- **TRANSFORMs Defined:** 4 (`getData`, `bldReport`, `addStats`, and one inline transform)
- **JOINs:** None (uses `DENORMALIZE` instead)
- **PROJECT Operations:** 3 (`es`, `cs`, `samples`)
- **SORT Operations:** 1 (in `addStats`)
- **DEDUP Operations:** None
- **ROLLUP Operations:** 1 (`s1`)
- **Child Workflows/Nested MODULEs:** None (uses a macro function)
- **OUTPUT Statements:** 1 (`AACT_Data`)
- **Conditional Logic:** Minimal (`IF` within transformations)
- **MACROs/Functions:** 1 macro (`Analyze_File`) invoked multiple times.

**Conversion Complexity Score:** 65/100
- **Incompatible Features:** Moderate (e.g., implicit schema typing, virtual fields).
- **Manual Refactor Points:** Moderate (e.g., RECORD structures, DENORMALIZE).
- **Workflow Challenges:** Low (modular design).
- **Volume/Nesting of Datasets:** High (40 datasets).

#### 3. Feature Compatibility Check:
- **Implicit Schema Typing:** Needs explicit schema definitions in Spark.
- **Recordsets and RECORD Structures:** Must be converted to case classes or schema definitions.
- **Dataset Transformations:** `PROJECT`, `ROLLUP`, and `DENORMALIZE` require manual refactoring.
- **Global Aggregates:** `ROLLUP` and `DENORMALIZE` must be rewritten using Spark's groupBy and aggregation functions.

#### 4. Manual Adjustments for Java Spark Migration:
- **TRANSFORMs to Spark UDFs:** Refactor `getData`, `bldReport`, and `addStats` as UDFs.
- **RECORD Structures:** Convert to case classes or explicit schema definitions.
- **JOIN Logic:** Rewrite `DENORMALIZE` using Spark's join and groupBy operations.
- **NORMALIZE, ROLLUP, DEDUP:** Use groupBy, aggregate, and distinct functions in Spark.
- **OUTPUT Targets:** Redirect to HDFS, Parquet, or other Spark-supported sinks.

#### 5. Optimization Techniques in Spark:
- **Broadcast Joins vs Shuffle Joins:** Use broadcast joins for small datasets.
- **Partitioning:** Partition datasets based on key fields for efficient processing.
- **Caching:** Cache intermediate datasets for reuse.
- **Catalyst Optimizer:** Leverage Spark's optimizer for query planning.
- **Dataframe API Improvements:** Use DataFrame transformations for better performance.

#### Recommendation:
**Rebuild Logic for Better Alignment with Spark.**
- Justification: The script uses ECL-specific constructs like RECORD structures, virtual fields, and DENORMALIZE, which require significant refactoring. Rebuilding ensures better compatibility and performance in Spark.
