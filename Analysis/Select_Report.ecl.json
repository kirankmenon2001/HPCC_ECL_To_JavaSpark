    "1. Script Overview": {
    "Summary": "This ECL script extracts and organizes clinical trial data from the AACT database based on a predefined set of NCT IDs. It aims to provide structured outputs for various aspects of clinical trials, such as arm groups, authorities, interventions, and others. By filtering and sorting data, it addresses the business need for traceable and organized clinical trial information.",
    "Functional Modules": [
    "DATASET declarations: AACT library datasets are used.",
    "TRANSFORM logic: None.",
    "PROJECT operations: None.",
    "OUTPUT operations: Used extensively to generate named outputs for filtered and sorted datasets."
    ],
    "Data Pipelines Overview": "The script processes datasets from the AACT library by filtering them based on a predefined set of NCT IDs. Each dataset is sorted by the NCT ID field and outputted with a specific name. This ensures that raw clinical trial data is transformed into organized outputs for downstream consumption."
