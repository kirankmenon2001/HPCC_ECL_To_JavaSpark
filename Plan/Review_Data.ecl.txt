#### 1. Cost Estimation

##### 1.1 Java Spark Runtime Cost

**Cluster Configuration:**
- Number of Executors: 10
- Executor Memory: 16 GB
- Driver Memory: 8 GB

**Approximate Data Volume Processed:**
- Total Input Data Volume: ~3 TB (based on the environment file)
- Estimated Data Processed: ~10–15% of input (~300–450 GB)

**Time Taken for Each Phase:**
- Shuffle-heavy Operations (e.g., COUNT, GROUP): ~2 hours
- Wide Transformations (e.g., TABLE, TOPN): ~1 hour
- Output Writes: ~1 hour

**Cost Model:**
- Provider: Databricks on AWS
- Cost per DBU: $0.25–$0.60 per hour
- Estimated DBU Consumption: ~50 DBUs per hour

**Total Runtime Cost:**
- Total Hours: ~4 hours
- Total DBUs: ~200 DBUs
- Estimated Cost: $50–$120 USD

**Justification:**
- Shuffle-heavy operations and wide transformations dominate the runtime due to the large data volume (~300–450 GB actively processed).
- Output writes are relatively lightweight but still contribute to runtime due to multiple named outputs.

#### 2. Code Fixing and Data Recon Testing Effort Estimation

##### 2.1 Estimated Effort in Hours

**Manual Intervention and Solutions of Complex Constructs:**
- Refactoring OUTPUT statements for Spark write APIs: ~10 hours
- Managing schema consistency across distributed stages: ~5 hours

**Data Recon and Pipeline Testing:**
- Test case creation: ~8 hours
- Validation of intermediate datasets: ~12 hours
- Output comparison: ~10 hours

**Syntax Differences:**
- Explicit schema definitions for datasets: ~6 hours

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Partitioning datasets for performance: ~4 hours
- Caching intermediate results: ~3 hours

**Total Effort:**
- Estimated Hours: ~58 hours

**Major Contributors:**
- Extensive OUTPUT operations requiring refactoring.
- Schema consistency management across distributed stages.
- Validation of intermediate datasets and output comparison.
