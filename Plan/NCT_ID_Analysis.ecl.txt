1. Cost Estimation
1.1 Java Spark Runtime Cost
Cluster Configuration:
- Number of Executors: 10
- Executor Memory: 16 GB
- Driver Memory: 8 GB

Approximate Data Volume Processed:
- Total Input Data Volume: ~5.65 TB (sum of all datasets listed)
- Active Data Processed: ~10–20% of total (~565 GB to 1.13 TB)

Time Taken for Each Phase:
- Shuffle-heavy JOINs: ~2 hours
- Wide Transforms (PROJECTs): ~1 hour
- Output Writes: ~1 hour

Cost Model:
- Using Databricks pricing at $0.25–$0.60 per DBU/hour:
  - Estimated DBU Usage: ~50 DBUs/hour
  - Total Runtime: ~4 hours
  - Cost: 50 DBUs/hour * 4 hours * $0.40 (average cost per DBU) = $80.00

Justification:
- The cluster configuration is designed to handle large-scale distributed processing efficiently.
- The cost is based on average DBU pricing and estimated runtime for the operations.

2. Code Fixing and Data Recon Testing Effort Estimation
2.1 Estimated Effort in Hours
Manual Intervention and Solutions of Complex Constructs:
- TRANSFORMs to UDFs: 10 hours
- RECORD Structures to Case Classes: 15 hours
- JOIN Logic Refactoring: 20 hours
- OUTPUT Statements Refactoring: 10 hours

Data Recon and Pipeline Testing:
- Test Case Creation: 10 hours
- Validation of Intermediate Datasets: 15 hours
- Output Comparison: 10 hours

Syntax Differences:
- Adjustments for syntax differences: 5 hours

Optimization Techniques:
- Partitioning and Caching: 10 hours
- Broadcast Joins vs Shuffle Joins: 5 hours

Total Estimated Effort: 100 hours

Major Contributors:
- Rewriting nested TRANSFORMs and rollups: High complexity due to manual refactoring.
- Refactoring OUTPUT statements for Spark write APIs: Moderate complexity.
- Managing schema consistency across distributed stages: High complexity.
