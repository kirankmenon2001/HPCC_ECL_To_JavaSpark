1. Cost Estimation
1.1 Java Spark Runtime Cost
- **Cluster Configuration**:
  - Number of executors: Determined based on data volume and complexity of transformations.
  - Executor memory: Sufficient to handle data transformations and caching.
  - Driver memory: Enough to coordinate tasks and handle metadata.

- **Data Volume Processed**:
  - Multiple datasets are processed, with sizes ranging from 350 GB to 480 GB.

- **Time Taken for Each Phase**:
  - Data projection: Optimized using Spark's Catalyst optimizer.
  - Grouping and aggregation: Efficient partitioning and caching to minimize shuffle operations.
  - Output generation: Writing data to storage using Spark write APIs.

- **Pricing Notes**:
  - Pricing depends on the cloud provider's Spark cluster costs, calculated based on the number of nodes, memory, and runtime duration.

2. Code Fixing and Data Recon Testing Effort Estimation
2.1 Estimated Effort in Hours
- **Refactoring**: ~40 hours (depending on the complexity of transformations).
- **Data Reconciliation**: ~20 hours.
- **Pipeline Testing**: ~30 hours.
- **Optimization**: ~20 hours.

- **Total Estimated Effort**: Approximately 110 hours.
