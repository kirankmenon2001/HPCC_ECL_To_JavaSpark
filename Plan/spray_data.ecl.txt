1. Cost Estimation
1.1 Java Spark Runtime Cost
Cluster Configuration:
- Number of Executors: 10
- Executor Memory: 8 GB
- Driver Memory: 4 GB

Approximate Data Volume Processed:
- Total Data Volume: ~950 GB (500 GB + 100 GB + 200 GB + 150 GB)

Time Taken for Each Phase:
- Shuffle-heavy JOINs: Not applicable (no JOINs in the script)
- Wide Transforms: 2 hours (due to PROJECT and TRANSFORM operations)
- Output Writes: 1 hour (writing ~950 GB of data)

Cost Model:
- Using Databricks on Azure:
  - DBU Cost: $0.25 per hour
  - Total Runtime: 3 hours
  - Total Cost: 10 executors * 3 hours * $0.25 = $7.50

Justification:
- The script involves spraying multiple files, each requiring transformation and output operations. The cost is calculated based on the DBU pricing and the estimated runtime.

2. Code Fixing and Data Recon Testing Effort Estimation
2.1 Estimated Effort in Hours
Manual Intervention and Solutions of Complex Constructs:
- TRANSFORMs to Spark UDFs: 5 hours
- RECORD Structures to Case Classes: 3 hours
- Refactoring OUTPUT statements: 2 hours

Data Recon and Pipeline Testing:
- Test Case Creation: 4 hours
- Validation of Intermediate Datasets: 6 hours
- Output Comparison: 5 hours

Syntax Differences:
- Adjusting syntax for Spark compatibility: 3 hours

Optimization Techniques:
- Partitioning and caching: 4 hours

Total Effort: 32 hours

Major Contributors:
- Rewriting nested TRANSFORMs and rollups: 5 hours
- Refactoring OUTPUT statements for Spark write APIs: 2 hours
- Managing schema consistency across distributed stages: 3 hours
