1. Cost Estimation
1.1 Java Spark Runtime Cost
Cluster Configuration:
- Number of Executors: 10
- Executor Memory: 16 GB
- Driver Memory: 8 GB
- vCPUs per Executor: 4

Approximate Data Volume Processed:
- Input Tables: ~2.2 TB total across all datasets
- Final Output Table (`t1`): ~5–10 GB
- Data actively processed: ~10–15% of input data (~330 GB)

Time Taken for Each Phase:
- Shuffle-heavy JOINs: ~2 hours
- Wide Transforms (PROJECT, ROLLUP): ~1.5 hours
- Output Writes: ~0.5 hours
- Total Estimated Runtime: ~4 hours

Cost Model:
- Databricks DBU Cost: $0.50/hour (average)
- Total DBUs Consumed: 10 executors * 4 hours * 1 DBU = 40 DBUs
- Total Cost: 40 DBUs * $0.50 = $20.00

Justification:
- The cost is based on the moderate transformation complexity and data volume, with optimizations like partitioning and broadcast joins applied.

2. Code Fixing and Data Recon Testing Effort Estimation
2.1 Estimated Effort in Hours
Manual Intervention and Solutions of Complex Constructs:
- Refactoring TRANSFORMs to Spark UDFs: 10 hours
- Converting RECORD structures to schemas: 5 hours
- Rewriting JOIN logic: 8 hours
- Refactoring ROLLUP operations: 6 hours
- Total: 29 hours

Data Recon and Pipeline Testing:
- Test case creation: 5 hours
- Validation of intermediate datasets: 10 hours
- Output comparison: 5 hours
- Total: 20 hours

Syntax Differences:
- Adjusting syntax for Spark compatibility: 4 hours

Optimization Techniques:
- Implementing partitioning and caching: 3 hours
- Total: 7 hours

Grand Total: 60 hours

Major Contributors:
- Rewriting nested TRANSFORMs and rollups.
- Refactoring OUTPUT statements for Spark write APIs.
- Managing schema consistency across distributed stages.
