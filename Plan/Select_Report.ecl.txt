1. Cost Estimation
1.1 Java Spark Runtime Cost
Cluster Configuration:
- Number of Executors: 10
- Executor Memory: 16 GB
- Driver Memory: 8 GB

Approximate Data Volume Processed:
- Total Input Data: ~3 TB
- Active Data Processed: ~10–15% (~300–450 GB)

Time Taken for Each Phase:
- Filtering and Sorting: ~2 hours
- Output Writes: ~1 hour

Cost Model:
- Databricks Enterprise DBU Cost: $0.25–$0.60 per hour
- Estimated Runtime Cost: (3 hours * 10 executors * $0.60) = $18.00

Justification:
- Filtering and sorting operations are shuffle-heavy, requiring significant memory and compute.
- Output writes involve moderate I/O overhead.

2. Code Fixing and Data Recon Testing Effort Estimation
2.1 Estimated Effort in Hours
Manual Intervention and Solutions:
- Explicit schema definitions for 38 datasets: 10 hours
- Refactoring OUTPUT statements to Spark write APIs: 8 hours
- Managing schema consistency: 5 hours

Data Recon and Pipeline Testing:
- Test case creation: 10 hours
- Validation of intermediate datasets: 15 hours
- Output comparison: 10 hours

Optimization Techniques:
- Partitioning and caching: 5 hours
- Catalyst optimizer hints: 3 hours

Total Estimated Effort: 66 hours

Major Contributors:
- Schema definitions and consistency management.
- Validation of intermediate datasets and output comparison.
